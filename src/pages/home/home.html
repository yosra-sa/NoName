  DevFest events cover multiple product areas such as Android, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Google Assistant, Flutter, machine learning with TensorFlow, and Mobile Web.
  Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community that hosts it.
    
    While no two events will be exactly alike, each event will, at its core, be powered by a shared belief that when developers come together to exchange ideas, amazing things can happen.
